# sample-graphql

This is a sample graphql server built with Typescript + Apollo Server

## Launch server

`yarn install` + `yarn dev`

# GraphQL Notes

## üìå Overview

**Official Website**: [https://graphql.org/](https://graphql.org/)

**One-liner summary**: Strongly typed, JSON-only, API handler.

### Key Characteristics

-   **Strongly typed** via **schema**
-   **Data-serving API**
    -   Not suitable for web frontend serving
-   **JSON-only**
    -   No XML or binary
    -   Binary alternatives:
        -   Base64
        -   Link to CDN/REST endpoint for binary data

## üöÄ GraphQL Operations

A GraphQL request is called an **operation**. There are three main types:

### 1. **Query**

-   Read-only (advisory, not enforced)
-   Similar to `GET` / SQL `SELECT`

### 2. **Mutation**

-   Modifies data (like `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
-   Handled by backend resolvers

### 3. **Subscription**

-   Long connections, typically over WebSockets

---

## üñ•Ô∏è GraphQL Server

A GraphQL server:

-   Runs on **one endpoint**, typically via `POST`
-   Can coexist with regular REST endpoints
-   Benefits from REST best practices:
    -   HTTP2, compression, HTTPS, etc.

### Mindset Shift

From **linear REST logic**:

-   Parse ‚Üí Access DB ‚Üí Clean ‚Üí Respond

To **graph-oriented design**:

-   Define resources
-   Connect via schema
-   Implement **resolvers** per resource
-   GraphQL engine handles resolver orchestration

## üìù Schema-First vs Code-First

| Style            | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Schema-First** | Define schema manually, then attach resolvers |
| **Code-First**   | Schema generated from code (Recommended)      |

## üß© GraphQL Client

Since GraphQL operates over HTTP, any REST client works.

### Example Operation

```graphql
query {
    student(id: "123") {
        id
        name
        contact
    }
}
```

### cURL Example

```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"query":"query{student(id:\"123\"){id name contact}}"}' <your-server-address>
```

### Node `fetch` Example

```js
const query = `
query {
  student(id: "123") {
    id
    name
    contact
  }
}
`;

fetch("<your-server-address>", {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ query })
}).then(...);
```

## üß∞ DevTools

-   Postman
-   GraphiQL / GraphQL Playground
    -   Usually comes with Graphql server framework, like Postgres' native IDE
-   Apollo DevTools (Browser extension)

## ‚öñÔ∏è REST vs GraphQL vs SQL

|               | REST                           | GraphQL                           | SQL                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Input**     | Endpoint + Method + Query/body | Fixed endpoint + query string     | SQL queries                        |
| **Output**    | Anything (JSON/XML/etc.)       | JSON, typed via schema            | Table data, typed                  |
| **Logic**     | Endpoint handler (function)    | Resolver (function)               | Limited, mostly querying           |
| **Strengths** | Flexible, universal            | Typed, shape-controlled, flexible | Precise querying, minimal response |

## ‚úÖ Benefits of GraphQL

### ‚úÖ Strong Typing

-   Consistent schema across teams
-   Tools like GraphQL Codegen enable type-safe client code

### ‚úÖ Two-pass Validation

-   Server validates:
    -   **Incoming query**
    -   **Outgoing response**

### ‚úÖ Optimized Response

-   Clients request **only** needed fields
-   Reduces over-fetching

### ‚úÖ Reduced Frontend/Backend Communication Overhead

-   **Self-serve data fetching for frontend**:
    -   Frontend developers can define exactly what data they need via GraphQL queries without waiting for backend developers to create or modify specific REST endpoints.
-   **Flexible response shaping**:

    -   Unlike REST, where the response shape is fixed per endpoint, GraphQL allows frontend to shape the response directly in the query. No more back-and-forth requests to ‚Äúadd a field‚Äù or ‚Äúremove a nested relation.‚Äù

-   **Avoid multiple backend iterations for UI changes**:

    -   Example:
        -   Traditional REST approach:
            -   Backend exposes `/product`, `/vendor`, `/order` endpoints.
            -   Frontend builds a dashboard page requiring data from multiple endpoints.
            -   Backend needs to create a `/dashboard` endpoint to combine data for performance optimization.
            -   Any dashboard changes = more backend work.
        -   GraphQL approach:
            -   Frontend simply writes a single query pulling `product`, `vendor`, `order` in one request.
            -   Backend remains unchanged as long as the schema supports the required fields.

-   **Fewer alignment meetings between teams**:

    -   Reduces typical cycles of:
        1. Frontend asks for an endpoint.
        2. Backend implements it.
        3. Frontend realizes extra fields are needed.
        4. Backend modifies again.
    -   With GraphQL, **schema evolves independently**, and frontend can iterate faster without constant backend adjustments.

-   **Cleaner separation of concerns**:
    -   Backend focuses on **business logic and data modeling**.
    -   Frontend focuses on **UI and data composition**.

### ‚úÖ Apollo Client Perks

-   Caching
-   Loading/Error states
-   Pagination & Infinite Scroll (FetchMore)
-   Reactive UI binding (Redux-like experience)

### ‚úÖ Normalized Client-Side Caching

-   **Automatic cache normalization**:
    -   Shared resources (e.g., `student(id: "123")`) across multiple queries and views are **de-duplicated** in the cache.
    -   When a resource is updated (e.g., via a `mutation`), all queries and UI components referencing the same resource ID will automatically reflect the updated data without requiring manual refresh or additional requests.
-   **Reduced redundant network requests**:
    -   GraphQL clients like Apollo avoid unnecessary requests by serving data directly from the cache if it‚Äôs already available, reducing server load and improving performance.

## ‚ùó Challenges of GraphQL

-   **Learning Curve**: Like React vs jQuery
-   **Backend-First Setup**: Best with GraphQL backend first
-   **Measuring Gains**: Performance gains aren‚Äôt always easy to quantify

<!-- ## üè¢ Companies Using GraphQL

-   **PayPal** ‚Äì Payment services
-   **Microsoft Teams**
-   **Snapchat**
-   **LinkedIn** ‚Äì Internal GraphQL-like system since 2020
-   **Coinbase** ‚Äì Full migration for customer-facing apps
-   **Instant Cart** ‚Äì ~70-80% services migrated
-   **WhyLabs** ‚Äì Full GraphQL adoption

## üß† GraphQL Design Philosophy

GraphQL views resources as a **graph**:

-   **Root Operations**: `query`, `mutation`, `subscription`
-   **Intermediate Nodes**: Connected resources
-   **Leaf Nodes**: Scalars (strings, numbers, etc.)

This leads to flexible, efficient, and maintainable API design.

# üèÅ Conclusion

GraphQL shines in large applications with complex data needs and multiple frontends. With tools like Apollo, strong typing, and streamlined queries, it reduces redundancy and improves developer efficiency ‚Äî albeit with an upfront investment in learning and backend setup.
