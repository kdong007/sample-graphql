# Graphql Tutorial

## Overview

First of all, this tutorial is based on my own experiences with graphql. Things may go wrong, always open for discussion.

In general, Graphql replaces JSON-response REST APIs. So:

-   If it is not an API, like an server side rendered HTML page => Not Graphql
-   If you want some non-JSON response, like images, videos, binary data => Not Graphql

A really abstract way of thinking Graphql is: **Graphql is a REST endpoint handler, sits on one REST endpoint. It is kind of like a SQL server accept SQL queries (select/update/delete... in Graphql grammar) in POST request, and return all responses in JSON.**

_Just to be clear, it is not DB. I don't want to confuse you by mentioning SQL_
